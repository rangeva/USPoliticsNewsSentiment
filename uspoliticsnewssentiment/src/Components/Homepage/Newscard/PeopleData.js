    about: 'Former President Trump was the first candidate to declare his intent to run for the GOP nomination in 2024. He also became the first former president to face any kind of criminal charges after being indicted by a Manhattan grand jury in a case related to a payoff to a porn star. He now faces federal criminal charges, too, related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents that were discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort. (Trump has denied wrongdoing in both cases.)',
